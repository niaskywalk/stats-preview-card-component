## My process

This is a simple stat card, so instead of just doing the card, I took the time to try some simple CSS3 properties I have not had time to use.

Inside, you will find CSS Variables, flexbox and blend-mode.

Although I got this pretty darned close using the tools mentioned, I just could not get the coloring of the image correct.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup (mostly)
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Variables can be useful, but maybe not use them for everything. I did not have a converter set up in my IDE so I could not use SASS.
Variables would work fantastically with mixins and addons, but in straight CSS it got a little confusing. Maybe I just need to work on it.

### Useful resources

- [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This is a great resources for quickly looking up flexbox commands.
